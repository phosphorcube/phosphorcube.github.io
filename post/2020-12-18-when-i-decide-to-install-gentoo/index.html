Why Gentoo? I was using Arch for a while, then started looking into Gentoo. I liked the way it’s package management works, being source based."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://phosphorcube.github.io/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://phosphorcube.github.io/css/cayman.f3c6873e1f9e178fed9968e08c595ff493cdd6b39bab53523968d3ddbe3ee563.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Anyways I might one day find the motivation to get back into blogging, who knows these days. Anyways I decided to write this post because I&rsquo;m using Gentoo now, a source based Linux distro.</p><h1 id=why-gentoo><strong>Why Gentoo?</strong></h1><p>I was using Arch for a while, then started looking into Gentoo. I liked the way it&rsquo;s package management works, being source based. So one day I took the leap, I installed Gentoo on my main computer, and I like it.</p><p>Why I use Gentoo Linux:</p><ul><li>USE flags! they are amazing and provide granular control over every package installed on my system</li><li>Optimization! now this is sorta overrated, <strong>do not use <code>-funroll-loops</code> or <code>-ffast-math</code> because those will make your system VERY unstable</strong>, instead settle on an march closest to your CPU and use CPU_FLAGS_X86</li><li>Control over the kernel! of course you can compile the kernel on any distro but on Gentoo it&rsquo;s the main way, however there is precompiled kernels if that is not your thing since configuring the kernel yourself can be intimidating if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with it, there&rsquo;s just something so satisfying about compiling your own kernel, and seeing eight penguins on the screen when starting up</li></ul><h1 id=why-not-gentoo><strong>Why not Gentoo?</strong></h1><p>Now I am not gonna be one of those people to say &ldquo;install Gentoo&rdquo; since Gentoo might not be the distro for everyone.</p><p>Why you might not want to use Gentoo:</p><ul><li>Compiling takes <em>forever</em> for a lot of packages, especially on a slow system</li><li>You might spend a lot of time configuring your computer the way you want</li><li>If you just want a stable system with little maintainance, Gentoo isn&rsquo;t the distro for you, I&rsquo;ll get into stability later</li><li><strong>Do not use Gentoo if you are a beginner to Linux</strong>, I&rsquo;m being dead serious about this, jumping into a distro like Gentoo as a beginner is a mistake and a half</li></ul><h1 id=stability><strong>Stability</strong></h1><p>Gentoo can be as stable or as unstable as you want, unfortunately a lot of people don&rsquo;t know the best practices for Gentoo and many completely screw up their system&rsquo;s stability. A Gentoo system that&rsquo;s configured properly tends to be very stable, I rarely have to reboot and when I do reboot it&rsquo;s usually by choice.</p><h1 id=updating-and-maintaining-a-gentoo-install><strong>Updating and maintaining a Gentoo install</strong></h1><p>This is tedious, I wrote a script to automate it for the most part, you&rsquo;ll still have to intervene in some cases and update your kernel manually.</p><h1 id=conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Gentoo is a good distro for some people, I like Gentoo. You might too.</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

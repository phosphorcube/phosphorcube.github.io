<p>I rarely if ever update this blog, maybe once every few months. Anyways I might one day find the motivation to get back into blogging, who knows these days. Anyways I decided to write this post because I&rsquo;m using Gentoo now, a source based Linux distro.</p>
<h1 id=why-gentoo><strong>Why Gentoo?</strong></h1>
<p>I was using Arch for a while, then started looking into Gentoo. I liked the way it&rsquo;s package management works, being source based. So one day I took the leap, I installed Gentoo on my main computer, and I like it.</p>
<p>Why I use Gentoo Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>USE flags! they are amazing and provide granular control over every package installed on my system</li>
<li>Optimization! now this is sorta overrated, <strong>do not use <code>-funroll-loops</code> or <code>-ffast-math</code> because those will make your system VERY unstable</strong>, instead settle on an march closest to your CPU and use CPU_FLAGS_X86</li>
<li>Control over the kernel! of course you can compile the kernel on any distro but on Gentoo it&rsquo;s the main way, however there is precompiled kernels if that is not your thing since configuring the kernel yourself can be intimidating if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with it, there&rsquo;s just something so satisfying about compiling your own kernel, and seeing eight penguins on the screen when starting up</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=why-not-gentoo><strong>Why not Gentoo?</strong></h1>
<p>Now I am not gonna be one of those people to say &ldquo;install Gentoo&rdquo; since Gentoo might not be the distro for everyone.</p>
<p>Why you might not want to use Gentoo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling takes <em>forever</em> for a lot of packages, especially on a slow system</li>
<li>You might spend a lot of time configuring your computer the way you want</li>
<li>If you just want a stable system with little maintainance, Gentoo isn&rsquo;t the distro for you, I&rsquo;ll get into stability later</li>
<li><strong>Do not use Gentoo if you are a beginner to Linux</strong>, I&rsquo;m being dead serious about this, jumping into a distro like Gentoo as a beginner is a mistake and a half</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=stability><strong>Stability</strong></h1>
<p>Gentoo can be as stable or as unstable as you want, unfortunately a lot of people don&rsquo;t know the best practices for Gentoo and many completely screw up their system&rsquo;s stability. A Gentoo system that&rsquo;s configured properly tends to be very stable, I rarely have to reboot and when I do reboot it&rsquo;s usually by choice.</p>
<h1 id=updating-and-maintaining-a-gentoo-install><strong>Updating and maintaining a Gentoo install</strong></h1>
<p>This is tedious, I wrote a script to automate it for the most part, you&rsquo;ll still have to intervene in some cases and update your kernel manually.</p>
<h1 id=conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>Gentoo is a good distro for some people, I like Gentoo. You might too.</p>

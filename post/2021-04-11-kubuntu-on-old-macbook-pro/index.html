<img src=/assets/kubuntu-on-2010-mbp/IMG_3435.JPG alt=Picture></p><h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>So macOS 10.13, it&rsquo;s ancient, at this point a lot of applications are dropping support, and it&rsquo;s happening really fast too. I still use my 2010 MacBook Pro as my secondary laptop because it&rsquo;s still quite useful as a little 13" laptop. It has tons of ports, and the size is great. Sadly it&rsquo;s old, it has a Core 2 Duo P8800 and an NVIDIA GeForce 320M, I maxed out the RAM at 8GB and installed a 250GB SSD.</p><p>I decided to wipe macOS completely, and install Kubuntu on it to use as a secondary laptop. So far it&rsquo;s been going well, I&rsquo;ve tried other distros like Arch Linux, Gentoo, Debian, Fedora, and they don&rsquo;t work nearly as well as the Ubuntu family.</p><h1 id=kubuntu-installation>Kubuntu Installation</h1><p>Installation was pretty easy, I just burned Kubuntu to a DVD and booted it in legacy mode, why? So I didn&rsquo;t have to do any hacks to make the NVIDIA GPU work properly. Installing from a DVD was quite a nostalgic experience. Something I don&rsquo;t do too often..
Once booted I was able to share the ethernet connection from my Lenovo IdeaPad and run the Kubuntu installer. During installation it pulled the <code>broadcom-wl</code> drivers. These seem to be fine at the moment, if there&rsquo;s any problems I could use <code>b43</code> or a USB adapter. After installation I installed the NVIDIA 340 drivers and was up and running.</p><h1 id=performance>Performance</h1><p>Using the proprietary NVIDIA 340 drivers which Ubuntu still maintains, performance seems to be decent. I would use <code>nouveau</code> if it had better compatibility, and didn&rsquo;t have graphical glitches with 3D acceleration.</p><h1 id=what-can-i-use-this-laptop-for>What can I use this laptop for?</h1><p>Well there&rsquo;s lots of things, here&rsquo;s a list:</p><ol><li>Web browsing</li><li>Light programming</li><li>Talking on chats</li><li>Connecting to computers remotely (what I usually use it for)</li><li>Light photo editing with Krita and GIMP</li><li>Media consumption</li><li>Most other things you can do on a laptop, just at a slower performance (it&rsquo;s 11 years old)</li></ol><h1 id=glxgears>Glxgears</h1><p><img src=/assets/kubuntu-on-2010-mbp/Screenshot_20210411_113815.png alt=Glxgears></p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
